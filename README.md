# culver-city-bus
[Culver City Bus](http://www.culvercity.org/enjoy/culver-city-bus) provides GTFS data to Google but currently has no mechanism for sharing open data. This project will find a means to digitize routes and stops in OpenStreetMap.

## Next steps
1. Review current Culver City bus stops in OSM
2. Find Culver City bus data
3. Plan and document import
